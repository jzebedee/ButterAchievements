### Fixes old saves

Saved games that previously had achievements disabled will earn achievements again. You can even save the game while using the mod and remove the "disable achievements" flag in your old save!

### Achievements in Sandbox mode

Sandbox games and saves will have all achievements active, so you can earn them without needing to play Story mode.
